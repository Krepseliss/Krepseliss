ðŸŽ“ Economic Science Student & Aspiring Data Scientist ðŸš€

Hello there! I'm an economics student based in Patras, Greece, gearing up to graduate June 2024. Data has always fascinated me, and I'm currently diving deep into the world of data science, working on my very first project which I have uploaded.

ðŸ’¼ What I'm Focused On:

    Completing my degree in economics with a strong academic record.
    Developing my first data science project, applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems.
    Enhancing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
